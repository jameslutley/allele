Welcome to your new Allele Rails app.

## What's included

- Authentication from [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
- A front-end framework in the shape of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
- Image uploads with [Carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) and file storage on S3 via [Fog](https://github.com/fog/fog)
- Save time on basic CRUD methods with [Inherited Resources](https://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources)
- Neat and easy to code forms with [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form)
- [Premailer](https://github.com/fphilipe/premailer-rails) takes a lot of hassle out of handling HTML emails
- [ExceptionNotifier](https://github.com/rails/exception_notification) lets you know when a user breaks something
